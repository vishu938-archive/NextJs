/**
 * In Next.js, when using parallel routes (like your @modal folder), the default.js file acts as the default content for that slot when no specific route is active in the parallel route.

In your case, @modal/default.js returns null, meaning:

When the modal slot is not being used (no modal is open), nothing is rendered in that slot.
If you navigate to a route that does not trigger a modal, the modal area remains empty because of this default.
Summary:
default.js in a parallel route provides fallback or empty content for that slot, ensuring your layout remains consistent and avoids errors when no modal is active.
